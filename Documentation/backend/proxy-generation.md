# Proxy Generation

> **Status**: This documentation is in progress and will be updated soon.

The TypeScript proxy generator automatically creates strongly-typed client code for your commands and queries, ensuring type safety between your backend and frontend.

## Overview

The proxy generator analyzes your backend API (commands and queries) and generates:

- TypeScript interfaces for all request and response types
- Strongly-typed proxy methods for invoking commands and queries
- Full IntelliSense support in your IDE
- Compile-time type checking

## Configuration

Configuration details for the proxy generator will be documented here.

## Usage
